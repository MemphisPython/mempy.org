`PyOhio 2015 <http://www.pyohio.org/>`_ has recently been announced, and
registration is now open! In their own words, PyOhio is:

    A free annual conference for Python programmers in and around Ohio,
    the entire Midwest, maybe even the whole world.

Having attended for the past few years, I highly recommend this conference.
You'll see high-quality talks, and meet great pythonistas from around
the world (really!).

To keep up with what's happening with the conference, be sure to follow
them on twitter at `@pyohio <https://twitter.com/pyohio>`_.
