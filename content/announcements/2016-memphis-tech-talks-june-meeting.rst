Memphis Tech Talks
------------------

On Thursday, June 16, the Memphis Technology Foundation & Fedex Institute of
technology are hosting an evening of lighthing talks. This will be a great
showcase of various tech topics from local professionals.

You can see the current `speaker lineup over at memphistechnology.org <http://www.memphistechnology.org/blog/2016/05/06/memphis-tech-talks-hosted-by-fit-and-mtf/>`_, and you can RSVP for the
event `on meetup.com <http://www.meetup.com/memphis-technology-user-groups/events/230661746/>`_.


MEMpy road trip
---------------

If you can only make one #memtech event this month, it should be the Tech Talks.
And since we think it'll be a spectacular evening, we're putting the regular
MEMpy meeting on hold this month.

However, if you need to get your Python fix, a few of us are planning a road
trip to visit `PyNash <http://pynash.org/>`_ on Thursday, June 23 at 6:00pm for
an introduction to Django Channels.

If you'd like to come along, please RSVP at `on the PyNash meetup <https://www.meetup.com/PyNash/events/231773313/>`, and get in touch with `Brad <mailto:brad@mempy.org>`_ / `@bkmontgomery <https://twitter.com/bkmontgomery>`_ or `Douglas <https://twitter.com/poweredbyaltnet>`_ for travel details.
