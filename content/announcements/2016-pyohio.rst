The always-great `PyOhio 2016 <http://www.pyohio.org/>`_ has recently been
announced, and will be held on July 30-31, 2016. PyOhio is:

    A free annual conference for Python programmers in and around Ohio,
    the entire Midwest, maybe even the whole world.

The `Call for Proposals <http://pyohio.org/call-for-proposals/>` is currently
up and open until *May 15*, so get your talk proposal in soon!  PyOhio is great,
for frist-time speakers, so if you've never spoken at a conference before, this
is the place to start. Even if you've spoken at dozens of conferences, this
is one you don't want to miss.

To keep up with what's happening with the conference, be sure to follow
them on twitter at `@pyohio <https://twitter.com/pyohio>`_.
