It's that time of the year, again. 2016 is almost over and it's time to slow,
down, reflect, and remember how great `PyTennessee <https://www.pytennessee.org/>`_
was. Now, let's get excited because that means PyTN 2017 is just around the corner!


That's right! The region's preeminent Python conference is happening February
4-5, 2017 in Nashville, TN. `Registration is currently open <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pytennessee-2017-tickets-26899174154>`_,
and you can grab a ticket for the low-low price of $60.


"How can such a great conference, with speakers from all over the world be
so cheap", you ask? It's only because of the generosity of the
`PyTN Sponsors <https://www.pytennessee.org/sponsors/>`_  that this can happen.
Thank you sponsors! (Don't see your company there?
`There's still time to become a sponsor <https://www.pytennessee.org/sponsors/prospectus/>`_!
