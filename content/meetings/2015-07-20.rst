Agenda
------

1. James Sheppard on `Rosalind <http://rosalind.info/about/>`_ and Biopython.
  Rosalind is an "online judge" that manages challenges starting from Python
  For-Loops up through complex bioinformatics problems.  Biopython is the main
  Python bioinformatics library; and it becomes ever more useful as the
  Rosalind challenges get harder.  This would be great for both people who
  are learning core concepts for the first time and those who simply enjoy
  code puzzles.
2. TBD (~30-60minutes)
3. TBD (~30-60minutes)
