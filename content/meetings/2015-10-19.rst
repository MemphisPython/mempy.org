Agenda
------

This month's agenda and format is a _Surprise!_ We'll mostly likely have a
short talk (possibly a python standard library module), but may also have
a short tutorial as well. If we wrap up early, we'll do an informal project
night / office hours. Have questions about something you're working on? Bring
it and stick around to talk afterwards.
