**Topic: Building Machine Learning Systems that Scale, by Brandon Smith**

Python is the most dominant language in the machine learning community for good
reason, yet there are significant challenges to scaling its use across an
organization. Going from working in a Jupyter notebook to training, coordinating,
managing, and serving thousands of models across a complex service requires
significant planning and infrastructure. Companies like Google, Uber, and
Facebook have spent years working on their own proprietary platforms and systems
in order to solve all of the issues that come with scale. In this talk, I'll
tackle the challenges unique to scaling a machine learning organization and how
those challenges are currently being solved by both large companies and small
startups.
