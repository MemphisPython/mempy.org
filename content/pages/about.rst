We are students, teachers, professionals, and hobbyists. Some of us build
apps for the web, while others are sysadmins or DBAs. Some of us are researchers
involved with scientific computing while some of us are toying with Raspberry
Pis. Some of us have been writing code for years. Some of us are just getting
started.

The goal of the Memphis Python User Group is to promote the use of the Python
programming language in the Mid-South. We aim to to share knowlege and to
nurture a community of Python professionals and enthusiasts. Each meeting is
open to the public and strives to appeal to both novices and professionals.

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
--------------------------------

`PEP 20 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_ is the origination of
the Zen of Python.

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
