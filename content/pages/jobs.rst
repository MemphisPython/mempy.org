Python Instructor
-----------------

The Rhodes College Department of Mathematics and Computer Science is looking
for someone who can teach one or two sections of our introductory computer
science class using Python this coming fall.  A masters degree is required
(though it doesn't have to be in CS). Teaching experience is preferred, though
enthusiasm could probably substitute.  The CS program at Rhodes has been
growing incredibly quickly and demand for intro CS is through the roof.

For additional details, contact Phil Kirlin, Dept of Math & CS at Rhodes College.
