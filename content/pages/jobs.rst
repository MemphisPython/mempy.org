Web Designer at SmartBear
-------------------------

SmartBear has played a role in the Uber you ordered, the banking app you use,
the item you posted for auction, or that flight you just purchased. SmartBear's
CrossBrowserTesting team is looking for a talented Web Designer. You will be a
vital member of our team responsible for creating and optimizing our marketing
website, emails, and website application tools. You will work closely with other
team members in developing mock-up, generating graphics, and implementing
HTML/CSS. The successful candidate will possess an eye for creative design and
enjoy working in a fast-paced, albeit fun tech-culture environment.

Python Instructor
-----------------

The Rhodes College Department of Mathematics and Computer Science is looking
for someone who can teach one or two computer science courses for us this
coming spring semester.  We are flexible on which course(s) they are;
traditionally we have had folks teach our Intro Programming in Python course,
but we would also be open to other courses in the CS curriculum, including an
upper-level elective like AI, Networks, Compilers, Game Design, Software
Engineering, or something of your choice.  A masters degree is required
(though it doesn't have to be in CS). Teaching experience is preferred, though
enthusiasm could probably substitute.  The CS program at Rhodes has been growing
incredibly quickly and demand for intro CS is through the roof.


For additional details, contact Phil Kirlin, Dept of Math & CS at Rhodes College.
